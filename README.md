#Scrumptious:

This app is for college students and people who desire organization in their kitchen.  People will be able to use this app to plan what meals they will have for the entire week and will be able to view a shopping list that includes all ingredients required for each recipe. College students and housemates in particular can use this app to coordinate who is cooking what for each meal, so that, even though not every student will be able to cook every meal, they will still be able to put together complex meals by combining their strengths.

Unlike other apps, which provide individual shopping lists, recipes, reminders, or tips, this app will bring them all together into one convenient location.  The recipe book will be searchable and it will easy to add a recipe to the weekly meal plan.  There will also be a place to add notes about modifications or cooking tips to a recipe. The reminder feature, which is not found in other cooking apps, will be very helpful for users with busy schedules so that they will not forget when to begin thawing or cooking food.

So whether we've got your support or not, we hope we've provided... Food for Thought.
